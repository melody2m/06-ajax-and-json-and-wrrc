# AJAX and JSON and WRRC

**Author**: Richard and Collin
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
It requests data from an external file using AJAX then we use local storage to maintain the data to render the page.  We do this so we can retreive data from all kinds of sources.    

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Use AJAX to request data, use localStorage to set the data and retreive it.  Then render the page with that data.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The technologies we used are AJAX and JQuery.  
## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
